    <h2>Invention of the first aircraft</h2>

<div class="pra"><p>In the late 18th century, the Montgolfier brothers invented the hot-air balloon and began manned flights.
At almost the same time, the discovery of hydrogen gas led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon.
Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period, such as fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion, led to the foundation of modern aerodynamics,
most notably by Sir George Cayley. Balloons, both free-flying and tethered, began to be used for military purposes from the end of the 18th century,
with the French government establishing Balloon Companies during the French Revolution. <br> <br>
In 1903, following their pioneering research and experiments with wing design and aircraft control, <br>
the <strong>Wright brothers </strong>successfully incorporated all of the required elements to create and fly the first aeroplane.
The basic configuration with its characteristic tail was established by 1909, followed by rapid design and performance improvements aided by the development of more powerful engines. <br>
Using a methodical approach and concentrating on the controllability of the aircraft,
the brothers built and tested a series of kite and glider designs from 1898 to 1902 before attempting to build a powered design.
The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their predecessors.
Their first full-size glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly.
Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested.
As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift.
Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher aspect ratio and true three-axis control.
They flew it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models.
By using a rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size prototypes,
the Wrights not only built a working aircraft the following year, the Wright Flyer, but also helped advance the science of aeronautical engineering. <br> <br>
<big>Fun fact:</big>in October 9, 1903, the New york times published an article predicting it would take one to ten million years for humanity to develop an operating flying machine.
but only months later in On December 17, 1903, the Wright brothers proved new york times and many others wrong by the successful flight of their airplane.

    <h2>Military use, especialy WW1</h2>
<p>Almost as soon as they were invented, aeroplanes were used for military purposes. <br>
The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose aircraft made reconnaissance,
    bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya during the Italian-Turkish war (September 1911 - October 1912). <br>
This war also saw Ottoman soldiers shoot down a warplane for the first time in history,
the first warplane reconnaissance mission flown on 23 October 1911 by the Italian air force's Captain Carlo Piazza,
and the first bombing mission flown on 1 November 1911 by Italy's Second Lieutenant Giolio Gavotti.
Bulgaria later followed this example. Its aeroplanes attacked and reconnoitred Ottoman positions during the First Balkan War 1912-1913. <br>
The first war to see major use of aeroplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World War I.
The Allies and Central Powers both used aeroplanes and airships extensively. <br> <br>

<big>Aircrafts proved usefull in WW1, becuase they were able to do stuff that no ground unit was able to do,
like <em>Spying on the enemy trenches and try to find out about the position pf enemy artillery and to take pictures,
drop bombs on enemy soldiers, and fighting enemy aircrafts that tried to do the same. <br> <br>  </big></em>

Artillery "spotting" enabled the ranging of artillery on targets invisible to the gunners. Radio telephony was not yet practical from an aircraft, so communication was a problem.
By March 1915, a two-seater on "artillery observation" duties was typically equipped with a primitive radio transmitter transmitting using Morse code, but had no receiver.
The artillery battery signalled to the aircraft by laying strips of white cloth on the ground in prearranged patterns.
Observation duties were shared with the tethered balloons, which could communicate directly with their batteries by field telephone,
but were far less flexible in locating targets and reporting the fall of shot. <br>

"Contact patrol" work attempted to follow the course of a battle by communicating with advancing infantry while flying over the battlefield.
The technology of the period did not permit radio contact, while methods of signalling were necessarily crude, including dropping messages from the aircraft.
Soldiers were initially reluctant to reveal their positions to aircraft, as they (the soldiers) found distinguishing between friend and foe problematic. <br>

Reconnaissance flying, like all kinds, was a hazardous business.
In April 1917, the worst month for the entire war for the RFC, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours. <br> <br>

Creating new units was easier than producing aircraft to equip them, and training pilots to man them. When the Battle of the Somme started in July 1916,
most ordinary RFC squadrons were still equipped with planes that proved easy targets for the Fokker.
New types such as the Sopwith 1Â½ Strutter had to be transferred from production intended for the RNAS.
Even more seriously, replacement pilots were being sent to France with pitifully few flying hours. <br>

Nonetheless, air superiority and an "offensive" strategy facilitated the greatly increased involvement of the RFC in the battle itself,
in what was known at the time as "trench strafing" - in modern terms, close support.
For the rest of the war, this became a regular routine, with both attacking and defending infantry in a land battle being constantly liable to attack by machine guns and light bombs from the air.
At this time, counter fire from the ground was far less effective than it became later, when the necessary techniques of deflection shooting had been mastered. <br> <br>

<div class="endofww1">

<h3>So what was the impact of aircraft in WW1?</h3>

<p>By war's end, the impact of aerial missions on the ground war was in retrospect mainly tactical; strategic bombing, in particular, was still very rudimentary indeed.
This was partly due to its restricted funding and use, as it was, after all, a new technology. On the other hand, the artillery,
which had perhaps the greatest effect of any military arm in this war,
was in very large part as devastating as it was due to the availability of aerial photography and aerial "spotting" by balloon and aircraft.
By 1917 weather bad enough to restrict flying was considered as good as "putting the gunner's eyes out".
Some, such as then-Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, commander of all American air combat units in France, claimed,
"The only damage that has come to Germany has been through the air".
Mitchell was famously controversial in his view that the future of war was not on the ground or at sea, but in the air. <br> <br>

<big>During the course of the War, the exact number of German, British and French planes destroyed is unknown.
However, the LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte suffered enormous losses, so much so that seeing a German plane was considered rare towards the end of the war.  </big> <br> </p>

<h2>The importanr role of aviation in WW2</h2>


<div class="pra"><p>During World War II, aviation firmly established itself as a critical component of modern warfare
from the Battle of Britain in the early stages to the great aircraft carrier battles between American and Japanese Pacific fleets and the final delivery of nuclear weapons.
The major belligerents, Germany and Japan on the one side and Britain, the United States and the USSR on the other,
manufactured huge air forces which engaged in pitched battles both with each other and with the opposing ground forces. <br>
Bombing established itself as a major strategic force, and this was also the first war in which the aircraft carrier played a significant role. <br> <br>

Aviation during this period was dominated by the conduct of the war, and the war in turn by air power. <br>
Aviation was heavily involved in the development of military technologies,strategies and events throughout the war. <br>  <br>

At the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1939,
the German <strong>Luftwaffe</strong>  had amassed an attack force of modern all-metal cantilever monoplanes designed to support the <strong>Blitzkrieg </strong>
style of warfare at relatively short range and manufactured by a large and organised industry.
Pilots had been well-trained, both in flying clubs and in some cases the Spanish Civil War.
Other European air forces, especially the British RAF were struggling to re-equip with similarly modern types and to train up aircrew.
Early German successes, with the notable assistance of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bomber, overran Europe and left Britain open to attack. <br> <br>

During the ensuing Battle of Britain, the British fighter squadrons had to quickly relearn the old tactical lessons from the first war.
Initially the RAF fighters flew in a tight three-fighter arrowhead formation, soon changing to the looser four-aircraft arrangement which the Germans called the "finger-four".
They soon also relearned the value of climbing above your opponent before attacking. At the same time,
the development of an early radar warning system by the British provided a new way to track German attack formations as they gathered over the European coast and flew across the English Channel.
The radio communications, provided to every pilot, also required new protocols such as radio silence before engaging the enemy.
Later on, the British and Americans developed large long-range heavy bombers, causing great damage to the German war effort and substantial casualties.
While the British favoured unescorted night bombing, the Americans preferred to mount daytime raids, escorted by long-range fighters.
In the Pacific war, both sides made extensive use of aircraft carriers and carrier-to-carrier engagements became pivotal turning points in several campaigns.

    <h2>The modernization of the aviation industry in The cold war to modern times</h2>


<div class="pra"><p>In the 1950s, radar was fitted to day fighters, since due to ever increasing air-to-air weapon ranges,
pilots could no longer see far enough ahead to prepare for the opposition. Subsequently, radar capabilities grew enormously and are now the primary method of target acquisition.
Wings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag, which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength. Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure,
but milled from large slabs of alloy. The sound barrier was broken, and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls, speeds quickly reached Mach 2,
past which aircraft cannot maneuver sufficiently to avoid attack. <br> <br>

Air-to-air missiles largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained,
however the Vietnam War showed that guns still had a role to play, and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon (typically between 20 and 30 mm (0.79 and 1.18 in) in caliber)
in addition to missiles. Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air-to-air missiles. <br> <br>
    
In the 1970s, turbofans replaced turbojets, improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engine support aircraft could be replaced with jets, making multi-role combat aircraft possible.
Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures, and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress. <br> <br>
    
With the steady improvements in computers, defensive systems have become increasingly efficient.
To counter this, stealth technologies have been pursued by the United States, Russia, India and China.
The first step was to find ways to reduce the aircraft's reflectivity to radar waves by burying the engines,
eliminating sharp corners and diverting any reflections away from the radar sets of opposing forces.
Various materials were found to absorb the energy from radar waves, and were incorporated into special finishes that have since found widespread application.
Composite structures have become widespread, including major structural components,
and have helped to counterbalance the steady increases in aircraft weightâmost modern fighters are larger and heavier than World War II medium bombers. <br>
    
Because of the importance of air superiority, since the early days of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers,
and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces. <br>
    
The global combat aircraft market was worth $45.75 billion in 2017 and is projected by Frost & Sullivan at $47.2 billion in 2026: 35% modernization programs and 65% aircraft purchases,
 dominated by the Lockheed Martin F-35 with 3,000 deliveries over 20 years. <br>

     <h2>The physics behind Aviation</h2>

    

    <div class="pra"><p>Now that we have talked about the history of aviation,Lets talk about the physics that allowed Aircrafts to fly in the first place.
and suprisingly,its not as complicated as you might think. <br><br> </p>

<h3>What is Air? </h3>
<p>
Air is a physical substance which has weight. It has molecules which are constantly moving. Air pressure is created by the molecules moving around.
Moving air has a force that will lift kites and balloons up and down.Air is a mixture of different gases; oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
All things that fly need air. Air has power to push and pull on the birds, balloons, kites and planes. <br><br> 

In 1640, Evagelista Torricelli discovered that air has weight. When experimenting with measuring mercury, he discovered that air put pressure on the mercury. <br>

Francesco Lana used this discovery to begin to plan for an airship in the late 1600s. He drew an airship on paper that used the idea that air has weight.
The ship was a hollow sphere which would have the air taken out of it. Once the air was removed, the sphere would have less weight and would be able to float up into the air.
Each of four spheres would be attached to a boat-like structure and then the whole machine would float. The actual design was never tried. <br> <br>

Hot air expands and spreads out and it becomes lighter than cool air. When a balloon is full of hot air it rises up because the hot air expands inside the balloon.
 When the hot air cools and is let out of the balloon the balloon comes back down. <br>  </p>

<h3>How do Wings Lift the Plane? </h3>
<p>
Airplane wings are shaped to make air move faster over the top of the wing. When air moves faster, the pressure of the air decreases.
So the pressure on the top of the wing is less than the pressure on the bottom of the wing. The difference in pressure creates a force on the wing that lifts the wing up into the air. <br><br>
