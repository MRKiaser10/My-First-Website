This website is the first website i ever made and was made by 15 year old me for practice. <br>
most of the content you see on this website is copy and pasted from wikipedia and other websites and only a small part of it was typed by myself,
most of them being larger than the text around them. <br> <br> <big>
this is just a small project made for practice,i dont think its gonna be usefull to anyone,
if you are intrested in the topic of the <a href="article.html">article page</a>,visit the <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia page</a> regarding it. <br> <br>  </big>
english isnt my first language,so apologies if there is any spelling mistakes <br> 
This is the Version 1.0 of the website,the first version of the website published on the internet (and probably the last). <br>
no JavaScript was used in any part of this website (as you can probably tell by the lack of interactivity). <br><br>
